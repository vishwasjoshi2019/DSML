# Q1. Needed hours

## Problem Description:

In a company, each employee must work a certain number of hours every month. Employees work in sessions.

The number of hours an employee worked can be calculated from the sum of the number of minutes the employee worked in all of their sessions.

The number of minutes in each session is rounded up.

For example, if the employee worked for 51 minutes and 2 seconds in a session, we consider it 52 minutes.
We use CEIL() function to return the smallest integer value that is bigger than or equal to a number.
Write a query to report the IDs of the employees that will be deducted. In other words, report the IDs of the employees that did not work the needed hours.

Order the output by employee_id in ascending order.
Sample Input:

Table: employees

Sample Explanation:

Employee 1:
Worked for three sessions:
On 2022-10-01, they worked for 8 hours.
On 2022-10-06, they worked for 8 hours and 4 minutes.
On 2022-10-12, they worked for 4 hours and 1 minute. Note that they worked through midnight.
Employee 1 worked a total of 20 hours and 5 minutes across sessions and will not be deducted.
Employee 2:
Worked for one session:
On 2022-10-29, they worked for 11 hours and 59 minutes.
Employee 2 did not work their hours and will be deducted.
Employee 3:
Did not work in any session.
Employee 3 did not work their hours and will be deducted.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT E.employee_id
FROM employees E
LEFT JOIN logs L 
ON E.employee_id = L.employee_id
GROUP BY E.employee_id, E.needed_hours
HAVING
(SUM(CEIL(IFNULL(TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, L.in_time, L.out_time),0) / 60)) / 60) < E.needed_hours
ORDER BY E.employee_id;
```
