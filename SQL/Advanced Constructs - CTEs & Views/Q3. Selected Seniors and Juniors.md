#  Selected Seniors and Junior

## Problem Statement:

A company wants to hire new employees. The budget of the company for the salaries is $70000.

The company's criteria for hiring are:

Keep hiring the senior with the smallest salary until you cannot hire any more seniors.
Use the remaining budget to hire the junior with the smallest salary.
Keep hiring the junior with the smallest salary until you cannot hire any more juniors.
Write a query to find the ids of seniors and juniors hired under the mentioned criteria.

Return the result table ordered by the employee_id column in ascending order.
Sample Input:

Table: candidates

Explanation:

We can hire 2 seniors with IDs (11, 2). Since the budget is $70000 and the sum of their salaries is $36000, we still have $34000 but they are not enough to hire the senior candidate with ID 13.
We can hire 2 juniors with IDs (1, 9). Since the remaining budget is $34000 and the sum of their salaries is $25000, we still have $9000 but they are not enough to hire the junior candidate with ID 4.

## Solution

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT *, SUM(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY experience ORDER BY salary) AS cum_sum
    FROM candidates 
)

SELECT employee_id FROM CTE
WHERE experience = 'Senior' AND 70000 > cum_sum

UNION

SELECT employee_id FROM CTE
WHERE experience = 'Junior' 
AND cum_sum < 70000 - (SELECT IFNULL(MAX(cum_sum), 0) FROM CTE WHERE experience = 'Senior' AND cum_sum < 70000)

ORDER BY employee_id;


OR

with senior as
(Select * from
(Select employee_id,sum(salary) over(order by salary) as running_sum from candidates where experience='Senior' )T where running_sum<=70000),

junior as
(select * from
(select employee_id,sum(salary) over(order by salary) as running_sum from candidates where experience='Junior')T
where running_sum<(select ifnull(70000-max(running_sum),70000)from senior))


select employee_id from senior
union all
select employee_id from junior
order by employee_id

```
