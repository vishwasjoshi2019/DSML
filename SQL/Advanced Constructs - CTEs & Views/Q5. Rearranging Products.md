Sample Explanation:

Product 0 is available in all three stores with prices 95, 105, and 110 respectively.
Product 1 is available in store2 with price 87 and store3 with price 85. The product 1 is not available in store1.
Product 2 is available in store2 with price 30 and store3 with price 40. The product 2 is not available in store1.

## Solution

```sql
select product_id, "store1" as store , store1 as price from Products 
where store1 is not null

union 

select product_id, "store2" as store, store2 as price  from Products 
where store2 is not null

union

select product_id, "store3" as store , store3 as price  from Products
where store3 is not null

order by product_id, store
```
