# Most frequently bought

## Problem Description :

Write a query to find the most frequently ordered product(s) for each customer.

The output should contain the product_id and product_name for each customer_id who ordered at least one order.

Order the output by customer_id and product_id in ascending order.
Use the CTE method.
Sample Input:

Table: products

Sample Explanation:

Andrew (customer 1) ordered the T-shirt three times and the Phone one time, so the T-shirt is the most frequently ordered product by him.
Erin (customer 2) ordered the Phone, the T-shirt, and the Shoes one time, so those are the most frequently ordered products by her.
Stanley (customer 3) only ordered the Shoes (two times), so that is the most frequently ordered product by him.
Jim (customer 4) only ordered the Phone (one time), so that is the most frequently ordered product by him.

## Solution

```sql

with CTE as (
    SELECT c.customer_id, p.product_id,p.product_name, count(order_id) as order_count
    from products p join orders o 
    on p.product_id=o.product_id 
    join customer c
    on c.customer_id=o.customer_id
    group by c.customer_id, p.product_id,p.product_name
)


select customer_id,product_id, product_name 
from CTE where order_count=(select max(order_count) from CTE t2 where t2.customer_id=CTE.customer_id)
order by customer_id,product_id
```
