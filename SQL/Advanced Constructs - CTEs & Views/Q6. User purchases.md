Given the data about the purchases made by different users,

Write a query to find the total number of users and the total amount spent for each date who have purchased using the mobile-only, the desktop-only, and both mobile and desktop together.

Return the result ordered by spend_date, and by platform in ascending order.
Use the CTE method.

## Solution

```sql

WITH SpendingCTE AS (
    -- STEP 1: Select columns user_id, spend_date, calculate mobile amount (ma), and desktop amount (da)
    SELECT
        user_id,
        spend_date,
        SUM(CASE WHEN platform = 'mobile' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS ma,
        SUM(CASE WHEN platform = 'desktop' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS da
    FROM Spending
    GROUP BY user_id, spend_date
),

MobileSpending AS (
    SELECT
        spend_date,
        'mobile' AS platform,
        SUM(case when ma>0 and da=0 then ma else 0 end) AS total_amount,
        SUM(case when ma>0  and da=0 then 1 else 0 end) AS total_users
    FROM SpendingCTE 
    GROUP BY spend_date
),
DesktopSpending AS (
    SELECT
        spend_date,
        'desktop' AS platform,
        SUM(case when da>0 and ma=0 then da else 0 end) AS total_amount,
        SUM(case when da>0 and ma=0 then 1 else 0 end) AS total_users
    FROM SpendingCTE 
    GROUP BY spend_date
),
BothSpending AS (
    SELECT
        spend_date,
        'both' AS platform,
        SUM(case when ma>0 and da>0 then ma+da else 0 end) AS total_amount,
       SUM(case when ma>0 and da>0 then 1 else 0 end)  AS total_users
    FROM SpendingCTE   
    GROUP BY spend_date
)
SELECT spend_date, platform, total_amount, total_users FROM MobileSpending
UNION ALL
SELECT spend_date, platform, total_amount, total_users FROM DesktopSpending
UNION ALL
SELECT spend_date, platform, total_amount, total_users FROM BothSpending
ORDER BY spend_date, platform;
