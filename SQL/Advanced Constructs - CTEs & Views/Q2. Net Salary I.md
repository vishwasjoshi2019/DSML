# Net Salary I


## Problem Statement:

Calculate the net salary for the employees and save the column as 'Net_Salary' and display the details of those employees whose net salary is greater than 15000.

Use the CTE method.
Note: To calculate the 'Net_Salary' = salary + salary *(commission_pct).

If the column 'comission_pct' consists of null values replace them with zeros using the ifnull() function.
For example: ifnull(commission_pct,0).

Return the columns 'employee_id', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'salary', and 'Net_Salary'.
Return the result ordered by employee_id in ascending order.
