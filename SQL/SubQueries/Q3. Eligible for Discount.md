Explanation:

Out of the three users, only User 3 is eligible for a discount.
- User 1 had one purchase with at least minAmount amount, but not within the time interval.
- User 2 had one purchase within the time interval, but with less than minAmount amount.
- User 3 is the only user who had a purchase that satisfies both conditions.

```sql
SELECT user_id
from purchases
where time_stamp between "2022-03-07" and "2022-03-21" and amount>1000
order by user_id
```
