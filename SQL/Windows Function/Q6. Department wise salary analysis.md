# Department wise salary analysis

## Problem Statement:

Write a query to calculate

the row number and save it as 'emp_row_no',
rank and save as 'emp_rank', and
the dense rank of employees as 'emp_dense_rank'
based on the salary column in descending order within each department using the employees table.

Return the columns 'full_name' (first_name and last_name separated by space), 'department_id', 'salary', 'emp_row_no', 'emp_rank', and 'emp_dense_rank'.
Return the result ordered by department_id in ascending order and salary in descending order.

 concat(first_name,' ',last_name) 'full_name', department_id, salary, 
 row_number() over(partition by department_id 
  order by salary desc) as emp_row_no, 
 rank() over(partition by department_id 
  order by salary desc) as emp_rank,
 dense_rank() over(partition by department_id 
  order by salary desc) as emp_dense_rank 
from employees
