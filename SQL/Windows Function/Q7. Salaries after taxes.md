# Salaries after taxes

## Problem Description:

Write a query to find the salaries of the employees after applying taxes. Round the salary to the nearest integer.

The tax rate is calculated for each company based on the following criteria:

0% If the max salary of any employee in the company is less than $1000.
24% If the max salary of any employee in the company is in the range [1000, 10000] inclusive.
49% If the max salary of any employee in the company is greater than $10000.
The salary after taxes = salary - salary x (taxes percentage / 100).
Return the result ordered by company_id, and employee_id in ascending order.
