# Q2. Same salaries

## Problem Description:

A company wants to divide the employees into teams such that all the members of each team have the same salary. The teams should follow these criteria:

Each team should consist of at least two employees.
All the employees on a team should have the same salary.
All the employees with the same salary should be assigned to the same team.
If an employee's salary is unique, we do not assign this employee to any team.
A team's ID is assigned based on the rank of the team's salary relative to the other teams' salaries, where the team with the lowest salary has team_id = 1.
Note that the salaries for employees not on a team are not included in this ranking.
Write a query to get the team_id of each employee that is in a team.

Return the result table ordered by team_id in ascending order. In case of a tie, order it by employee_id in ascending order.
Sample Input:

Table: employees

Sample Explanation:

Andrew (employee_id=1) and Erin (employee_id=2) are on the same team because they have the same salary of 5000.
Jim (employee_id=4) and Oscar (employee_id=5) are on the same team because they have the same salary of 8000.
Stanley (employee_id=3) is not included in any team because their salary of 4700 is unique (i.e. no other employee has the same salary).
The team IDs are assigned as follows (based on salary ranking, lowest first):
- team_id=1: Andrew and Erin, a salary of 5000
- team_id=2: Jim and Oscar, a salary of 8000
Stanley's salary of 4700 is not included in the ranking because he is not on a team.

## Solution

```sql

Select *, dense_rank() over(order by salary) as team_id
from employees
where salary not in(
select salary
from employees
group by salary
having count(*) = 1)
order by team_id, employee_id;

```
