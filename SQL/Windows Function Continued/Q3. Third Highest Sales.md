Sample Explanation:

For example, consider the product with productCode S18_2870 the sales are calculated as (114.84 * 46 = 5282.64).
Similarly, we calculate the sales for each customer and each orderNumber. Later, we compare the sales of the customer for all orders with the thirdHighestSales of that customer only.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT o.customerNumber, o.orderNumber, od.productCode,
(od.quantityOrdered * od.priceEach) as sales, 
NTH_VALUE(od.quantityOrdered * od.priceEach, 3) 
OVER(PARTITION BY o.customerNumber ORDER BY (od.quantityOrdered * od.priceEach) DESC 
RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) as thirdHighestSales
FROM orders o
JOIN orderdetails od 
ON o.orderNumber = od.orderNumber 
ORDER BY o.customerNumber, sales DESC;
```
