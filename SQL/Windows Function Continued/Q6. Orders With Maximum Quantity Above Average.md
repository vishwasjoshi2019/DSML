# Orders With Maximum Quantity Above Average

## Problem Statement:

You are running an e-commerce site that is looking for imbalanced orders.

An imbalanced order is one whose maximum quantity is strictly greater than the average quantity of every order (including itself).

The average quantity of an order is calculated as (total quantity of all products in the order) / (number of different products in the order).

The maximum quantity of an order is the highest quantity of any single product in the order.

Write a query to find order_id of all imbalanced orders.

Return the result table ordered by order_id in ascending order.
Sample Input:

Table: ordersdetails

Explanation:

The average quantity of each order is:
order_id=1: (12+10+15)/3 = 12.3333333
order_id=2: (8+4+6+4)/4 = 5.5
order_id=3: (5+18+20)/3 = 14.333333
order_id=4: (2+8)/2 = 5
order_id=5: (9+9)/2 = 9
The maximum quantity of each order is:
order_id=1: max(12, 10, 15) = 15
order_id=2: max(8, 4, 6, 4) = 8
order_id=3: max(5, 18, 20) = 20
order_id=4: max(2, 8) = 8
order_id=5: max(9, 9) = 9
Orders 1 and 3 are imbalanced because they have a maximum quantity that exceeds the average quantity of every order.
---

## Solution

```sql

select order_id
from OrdersDetails
group by order_id
having max(quantity) > all (
    select (sum(quantity) /
            count(distinct product_id)) as avg_quant_order
    from OrdersDetails
    group by order_id
)
order by order_id asc

```
