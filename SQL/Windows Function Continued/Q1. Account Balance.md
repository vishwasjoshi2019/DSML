# Account Balance

## Problem Statement:

Write a query to report the balance of each user after each transaction. You may assume that the balance of each account before any transaction is 0 and that the balance will never be below 0 at any moment.

Return the result table in ascending order by account_id, then by day in case of a tie.

Sample Input:

Table: transactions

Explanation:

Account 1:
Initial balance is 0.
2021-11-07 --> deposit 2000. Balance is 0 + 2000 = 2000.
2021-11-09 --> withdraw 1000. Balance is 2000 - 1000 = 1000.
2021-11-11 --> deposit 3000. Balance is 1000 + 3000 = 4000.
Account 2:
Initial balance is 0.
2021-12-07 --> deposit 7000. Balance is 0 + 7000 = 7000.
2021-12-12 --> withdraw 7000. Balance is 7000 - 7000 = 0.
---

## Solution

```sql

SELECT account_id, day,
SUM(CASE 
WHEN type = 'Deposit' THEN amount
ELSE -amount end)
OVER(partition by account_id order by day asc) AS balance
FROM transactions
ORDER BY account_id, day;

```
