# Q1. Human traffic


## Problem Description:

Each row in the table contains the visit_date and visit_id to the mall with the number of people during the visit. No two rows will have the same visit_date

Write a query to display the records when three or more rows with consecutive IDs have number of people is greater than or equal to 100 for each of them.

Return the id, visit_date, and people.
Return the result ordered by visit_date in ascending order.
Sample Input:

Table: mall

Sample Output:

Sample Explanation:

The five rows with ids 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 have consecutive ids, and each of them has ≥ 100 people attended. Note that row 5 was included even though the visit_date was not the next day after row 4 ( we check only with consecutive IDs which may and may not be consecutive dates).
The rows with ids 1 and 3 are not included because we need ≥ 100 people.
The row with id 2 was not included because we need three or more rows with consecutive IDs.

## Solution

```sql
select id, visit_date, people
from
(select id, visit_date, people, 
lead(people) over (order by id asc) as next1,
lead(people,2) over (order by id asc) as next2,
lag(people)over (order by id asc) as prev1,
lag(people,2)over (order by id asc) as prev2
from mall
)as mall_ppl
where (people >= 100 and next1 >= 100 and next2 >= 100) or 
(people >= 100 and prev1 >= 100 and prev2 >= 100) or
(people >= 100 and prev1 >= 100 and next1 >= 100)
order by visit_date;
```
