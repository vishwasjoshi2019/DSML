# Expensive products

## Problem Description:

Write a query to retrieve the productLine, productName, and MSRP (i.e., Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price) for all products, along with the third most expensive product and the fifth most expensive product within each product line, based on their MSRP.

Order the output by productLine in ascending order and by MSRP in descending order.
Sample Input:

Table: products



Sample Output:



Sample Explanation:

Here, in the Classic Cars product line based on MSRP '1968 Ford Mustang' is the third most expensive product, and the '1992 Ferrari 360 Spider red' is the fifth most expensive product.
Similarly in the Trains product line based on MSRP '1962 City of Detroit Streetcar' is the third most expensive product, and there are only three products hence, the fifth most expensive product is NULL.

---

## Solution

```sql

SELECT productLine, productName, MSRP, 
NTH_VALUE(productName, 3) OVER (PARTITION BY productLine ORDER BY MSRP DESC) as thirdMostExpensive_Product,
NTH_VALUE(productName, 5) OVER (PARTITION BY productLine ORDER BY MSRP DESC) as fifthMostExpensive_Product
FROM products
ORDER BY productLine, MSRP DESC;

```
