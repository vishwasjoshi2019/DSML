# Sales Quartile

## Problem Description:

Write a query to get the total amount for each customer who made payments along with their sales quartile based on the amount in descending order.

Quartile refers to any of the 4 equal bins into which a data set can be divided, based on the values of a particular variable.
Here, based on the total_amount we need to divide data into 4 equal bins. Where the 1st bin consists of the highest total_amount and the 4th bin consists of the lowest total_amount.
Order the output by total_amount in descending order and by sales_quartile in ascending order.
Sample Input:

Table: customers

Sample Explanation:

For example, consider customer Boards & Toys Co. with customerNumber 219 made two payments with amounts (i.e. 3452.75 + 4465.85 = 7918.60).
Similarly, the total amounts are calculated for each customer and then we divide the customers into 4 different bins based on the total_amount in descending order.
Where the customer who paid the highest total_amount falls under the 1st bin and the customer with the lowest total_amount falls under the 4th bin.

## Solution

```sql

SELECT c.customerName, SUM(p.amount) AS total_amount, 
NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(p.amount) DESC) AS sales_quartile
FROM customers c
JOIN payments p
ON c.customerNumber = p.customerNumber
GROUP BY c.customerName
ORDER BY total_amount desc, sales_quartile;

```
