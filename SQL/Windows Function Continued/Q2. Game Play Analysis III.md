## Problem Statement:

Write a query to report for each player and date, how many games played so far by the player.

That is the total number of games played by the player until that date.

Return the result table ordered by player_id and games_played_so_far in ascending order.

Explanation:

For the player with id 1, 5 + 6 = 11 games played by 2016-05-02, and 5 + 6 + 1 = 12 games played by 2017-06-25.
For the player with id 3, 0 + 5 = 5 games played by 2018-07-03.
Note that for each player we only care about the days when the player logged in.

## Solution

```sql

SELECT
player_id, event_date, 
sum(games_played) over(PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date)
AS 'games_played_so_far'
FROM activity
ORDER BY player_id, games_played_so_far;

```
