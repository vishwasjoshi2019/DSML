## Solution

```sql
SELECT
    distinct first_name,
    nth_value(start_date,1) OVER (PARTITION BY e.employee_id ORDER BY start_date DESC) AS recent_job
FROM employees e
JOIN job_history jh ON e.employee_id = jh.employee_id
ORDER BY first_name;

OR

select distinct first_name, last_value(start_date)
over(partition by jhist.employee_id
order by start_date asc
RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) as 'recent_job'
from job_history jhist
join employees emp 
on jhist.employee_id=emp.employee_id
order by first_name;


//Approach 2:

SELECT first_name, 
MAX(start_date) AS "recent_job" 
FROM employees 
JOIN job_history 
USING (employee_id) 
GROUP BY employee_id,first_name 
ORDER BY first_name;
```
