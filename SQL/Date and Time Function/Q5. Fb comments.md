Sample Explanation:

Users with user_id 4 and 7 are not included in the output as they haven't received any comment in the defined time period.
Users with user_id 5 and 8 are included in the output as they have received some comments in the defined time period.

## Solution

```sql
select 
 user_id, 
 sum(number_of_comments) as 'comments_count'
from fb_comments
where 
 created_at between DATE_SUB('2020-02-10', INTERVAL 30 DAY) 
 and '2020-02-10'
group by user_id
order by user_id;

```
