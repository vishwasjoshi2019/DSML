Explanation:

The buyer with buyer_id = 1 ordered one time in 2019. (on 2019-08-01)
buyer_id = 2 ordered two times in 2019. (2019-08-03 and 2019-08-05)
Other buyers did not order anything in 2019.

## Solution

```sql
select user_id as buyer_id, join_date, 
    sum(case when order_id is not null then 1 else 0 end) as orders_in_2019
from users
left join orders on users.user_id = orders.buyer_id 
and year(order_date) = 2019
group by user_id, join_date
order by buyer_id
```
