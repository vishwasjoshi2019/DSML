# New Users Daily Count


## Problem Statement:

Write a query to report for every date within at most 90 days from today, the number of users that logged in for the first time on that date. Assume today is 2019-06-30.

Return the result table ordered by login_date in ascending order.
Sample Input:

Table: traffic

Sample output:

Explanation:

Note that we only care about dates with nonzero user count.
The user with id 5 first logged in on 2019-03-01 so he's not counted on 2019-06-21.

## Solution

```sql
select mindate as login_date, count(user_id) as user_count
from (select user_id, min(activity_date) as mindate
        from traffic 
        where activity = 'login'
        group by user_id) t
where datediff('2019-06-30', mindate) <= 90
group by mindate
order by login_date
```
