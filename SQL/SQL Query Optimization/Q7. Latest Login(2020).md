Explanation:

User 6 logged into their account 3 times but only once in 2020, so we include this login in the result table.
User 8 logged into their account 2 times in 2020, once in February and once in December. We include only the latest one (December) in the result table.
User 2 logged into their account 2 times but only once in 2020, so we include this login in the result table.
User 14 did not login in 2020, so we do not include them in the result table.

## Solution

```sql
select distinct user_id,first_value(time_stamp) over(partition by user_id order by time_stamp desc) as last_stamp
from logins 
where year(time_stamp)=2020
order by user_id

OR

SELECT user_id, 
MAX(time_stamp) AS last_stamp 
FROM logins 
WHERE extract(year from time_stamp) = 2020
GROUP By user_id
ORDER BY user_id;
```
