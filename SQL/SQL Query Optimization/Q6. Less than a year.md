# Less than a year

## Problem Statement:

Write a query to display the details of the employees who had worked less than a year.

Return the columns 'employee_id', 'full_name'(first name and last name separated by space), and 'job_title'.
Note:

To calculate the number of years employees worked take the difference between the end_date and the start_date and divide the result by 365.
For simplicity not considering the leap year.
Referring only to the past jobs of the employees. Refer to the job_history table to get the past job details of the employees.
Return the result ordered by employee_id, and job_title in ascending order.
